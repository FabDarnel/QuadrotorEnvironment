Here's an overview of some common obstacle avoidance algorithms and their strengths and weaknesses:

Potential Field Method:

Strengths: Simple, computationally efficient, and easy to implement.
Weaknesses: May get stuck in local minima and oscillations around obstacles.
Vector Field Histogram (VFH):

Strengths: Robust to sensor noise and relatively computationally efficient.
Weaknesses: Requires fine-tuning of parameters for different environments.
Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT):

Strengths: Effective for high-dimensional spaces and nonholonomic constraints.
Weaknesses: Can be slow in complex environments and may not find the optimal path.
A* and Dijkstra:

Strengths: Guaranteed to find the optimal path in known environments.
Weaknesses: Not suitable for dynamic or unknown environments, and can be computationally expensive.
Deep learning-based methods (e.g., CNN):

Strengths: Can learn complex patterns and generalize well to unseen environments.
Weaknesses: Require large amounts of training data and may be computationally expensive.
Proposed algorithms:

Heuristic-based: A* algorithm
A* is a popular pathfinding algorithm with a good balance between optimality and computational efficiency. It can be easily adapted to work with dynamic environments, although it may require some adjustments to account for changes in the environment.

Machine learning-based: CNN
A CNN-based approach can learn complex patterns from data and generalize well to unseen environments. You can train a CNN on labeled data (e.g., images with obstacle locations) to predict obstacle-free paths for the drone.
