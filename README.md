# QuadrotorEnvironment
# Project Scope for UTM-Enabled UAV Environment

##  Objective
Develop a simulation environment for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that integrates the Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) system. The simulation environment will be used to test and evaluate various UAV control and communication algorithms, as well as the performance of the UTM system.

##  Features
* The environment will simulate a 3D airspace environment with UAVs, obstacles, and a ground control station (GCS).
* The environment will incorporate the UTM system to provide traffic management and communication between the UAVs and the GCS.
* The environment will provide a variety of sensor data to the UAVs, including GPS, lidar, and camera data.
* The environment will provide tools for generating random obstacles and configuring the environment complexity.
* The environment will include multiple types of UAVs with different capabilities and configurations, including fixed-wing and multirotor UAVs.

##  Deliverables
* A working simulation environment with documentation and user manual.
* A set of predefined scenarios for testing and evaluating UAV control and communication algorithms.
* A set of benchmark tests for evaluating the performance of the UTM system.

##  Project Scope for CNN-based Obstacle Avoidance Algorithm
##  Objective
* Develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) based algorithm for obstacle avoidance in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The algorithm will use camera data to detect obstacles in the UAV's path and determine the best course of action to avoid them.

##  Features
* The algorithm will use a CNN to analyze camera data and detect obstacles.
* The algorithm will determine the best course of action to avoid the obstacles, based on the UAV's current position, velocity, and orientation.
* The algorithm will be integrated with a simulation environment for testing and evaluation.
* The algorithm will be designed to work with different types of UAVs, including fixed-wing and multirotor UAVs.
* The algorithm will be tested and evaluated using a set of predefined scenarios and benchmarks.
##  Deliverables
* A working obstacle avoidance algorithm with documentation and user manual.
* A set of test results and evaluations demonstrating the performance of the algorithm under different scenarios and benchmarks.
